## Overview

Mixup-Final is designed with a decoupled architecture:
- **Server (Backend):** Handles API requests, data processing, and business logic. The server may be built using Node.js, Python, or another framework.
- **Client (Frontend):** Provides a user interface and interacts with the backend through API calls. Typically built using React, Vue, or another modern JavaScript framework.

This guide explains how to run the application locally for development and testing, as well as how to deploy it using Render’s hosting services.

## Repository Structure

Below is an example layout. Adjust paths based on your actual project structure:

```
mixup-final/
├── server/                  # Backend code (e.g., Node.js or Python)
│   ├── package.json         # For Node.js projects
│   ├── requirements.txt     # For Python projects
│   ├── app.js or app.py     # Entry point for your server
│   └── .env.example         # Sample environment variables file
├── client/                  # Frontend code (e.g., React or Vue)
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── public/
│   ├── src/
│   └── README.md
└── README.md                # This file
```

## Prerequisites

- **Git**: To clone the repository.
- **Node.js & npm**: For JavaScript-based projects (both server and client).
- **Python & pip**: If your backend is built in Python.
- **Render Account**: For deploying your application.
- **Additional Dependencies**: Any additional tools or packages as required by your project (e.g., database engines, Docker, etc.).

## Local Development Setup

### Cloning the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/athulns/mixup-final.git
cd mixup-final
```

### Installing Dependencies

#### Server

1. **Navigate to the server directory:**

   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   - For **Node.js**:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - For **Python**:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

#### Client

1. **Navigate to the client directory:**

   ```bash
   cd ../client
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Setting Up Environment Variables

- **Server:**  
  Create a `.env` file in the server directory. Copy the contents from `.env.example` (if provided) and update with your local configuration (e.g., `PORT`, `DATABASE_URL`, etc.).

- **Client:**  
  If your client requires environment variables (e.g., API endpoints), create a `.env` file in the client directory as needed.

### Running Locally

#### Server

Start the backend server:

- For **Node.js**:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```
- For **Python** (example using Flask):
  ```bash
  python app.py
  ```

Your server should now be running on `http://localhost:<PORT>` (replace `<PORT>` with the actual port, commonly 3000 or 5000).

#### Client

Start the frontend development server:

```bash
npm start
```

The client will typically run on `http://localhost:3000` or another configured port.

---

## Testing

- **API Testing:** Use tools like Postman or curl to verify that the API endpoints are responding correctly.
- **Frontend Testing:** Interact with the client application via the browser to ensure it correctly communicates with the backend.
- **Unit & Integration Tests:** Run any test suites available in the project using:
  
  ```bash
  npm test   # for Node.js projects
  pytest     # for Python projects
  ```

---

## Deployment on Render

Render allows you to host your server and client separately with minimal configuration.

### Deploying the Server

1. **Log in to Render** and go to your dashboard.
2. **Create a New Web Service:**
   - Click **New** and select **Web Service**.
   - Connect your GitHub account and select the `athulns/mixup-final` repository.
3. **Configure the Service:**
   - **Branch:** Select the branch (e.g., `main`).
   - **Build Command:**  
     - For Node.js: `npm install`
     - For Python: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **Start Command:**  
     - For Node.js: `npm start`
     - For Python: e.g., `gunicorn app:app`
   - **Environment Variables:** Add variables required for production.
4. **Deploy:** Click **Create Web Service**. Render will build and deploy your server.

### Deploying the Client

1. **Create a New Static Site:**
   - In your Render dashboard, click **New** and select **Static Site**.
   - Connect your GitHub account and select the repository.
2. **Configure Build Settings:**
   - **Branch:** Choose the branch containing your client code.
   - **Root Directory:** If your client is in a subdirectory (e.g., `client`), specify it here.
   - **Build Command:** Use a command like `npm install && npm run build`.
   - **Publish Directory:** Set the output folder (commonly `build` or `dist`).
3. **Deploy:** Click **Create Static Site** and Render will deploy your client.

## Troubleshooting

- **Dependency Issues:**  
  Ensure you have the correct version of Node.js, Python, or any other required tools installed.
- **Environment Variables:**  
  Double-check your `.env` file settings both locally and on Render.
- **Build Failures on Render:**  
  Review the build logs in Render to diagnose and resolve any errors during the deployment process.
